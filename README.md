""" Weekly essential Shopping Cart Expense Tracker"""

""" We all have so called budget planning for our overall expense. An average household
canadian household savings rate is just below 7%. Most of us spend roughly 15 % of our income towards
the groceries and other essential goods and sometimes end up paying more for the non essentials.
Here we come up with a solution that can help you to create a cart before you go to the super store to track the spending towards the essentials weekly.
This would help us to stay top on budget and support us for the long term savings ."""
